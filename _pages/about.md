Hello, my name is André Luiz Buarque Vieira e Silva and I am a PhD Student in Computer Science at Centro de Informática (CIn) in Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE). I also hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science at UFPE, and my Bachelor's is in Computer Engineering at UFPE. I have experience in the topics of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Particle-based Fluid Simulation and CUDA parallelization. My current research interest is in Image-based Defect Inspection and Anomaly Detection. Facial biometrics is also a current interest.

My PhD research explores Unsupervised Learning to improve Anomaly Detection and Defect Inspection in the wild. Thus, my focus is to propose and investigate Unsupervised Deep Learning approaches to improve automatic defect and anomaly detection on data from "in-the-wild" scenarios, in which defect-related data is quite rare (for example, UAV/drone images of power line assets). Through unprecedented datasets, which me and my colleagues proposed, I am exploring the entire inspection process, from the data collection step until deploying the whole system. Besides, my research is focused on detecting defects and anomalies in challenging scenarios with little prior information regarding the anomaly/defect itself.

During 2022 I was in Germany at TU Chemnitz as a DAAD scholarship holder for six months to deepen my PhD studies. I worked under the guidance of Jun.-Prof. Danny Kowerko in the Media Computing research group to advance the state of the art in Attention-based Image-level Anomaly Detection. From this experience, in 2023, we had an accepted poster in a CVPR workshop — 1st workshop on Vision-based InduStrial InspectiON ([VISION](https://vision-based-industrial-inspection.github.io/cvpr-2023/)) and a WACV 2024 main conference paper [AttentDifferNet](https://andreluizbvs.github.io/AttentDifferNet/). 

Also in 2023, we had a dataset paper, [InsPLAD](https://andreluizbvs.github.io/InsPLAD/), accepted in the International Journal of Remote Sensing (Impact Factor: 3.4). This paper was a result of my PhD research in collaboration with two brazilian companies: Sistema de Transmissão Nordeste and In Forma Software.
