Hello, my name is André Luiz Buarque Vieira e Silva and I am a PhD Student in Computer Science at Centro de Informática (CIn) in Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE). I have experience in the topics of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Particle-based Fluid Simulation and CUDA parallelization. My current research interest is in Image-based Industrial Inspection and Anomaly Detection in the wild. Facial biometrics is also a current interest.

My PhD research focus is to propose and investigate semi-supervised Deep Learning approaches to improve automatic defect and anomaly detection on data from "in-the-wild" scenarios, in which defect-related data is quite rare (for example, UAV/drone images of power line assets). Through new datasets (see [InsPLAD](https://andreluizbvs.github.io/InsPLAD/)) I am exploring the entire inspection process, from the data collection step until deploying the entire pipeline into production. Again, this is a challenging scenario since there is little or no prior information regarding the anomaly/defect itself.

During 2022 I was in Germany at TU Chemnitz as a DAAD scholarship holder for six months to deepen my PhD studies. I worked under the guidance of Jun.-Prof. Danny Kowerko in the Media Computing research group to advance the state of the art in Attention-based Image-level Anomaly Detection. From this experience, in 2023, we had an accepted poster in a <b>CVPR workshop</b> — 1st workshop on Vision-based InduStrial InspectiON ([VISION](https://vision-based-industrial-inspection.github.io/cvpr-2023/)) and a <b>WACV</b> 2024 main conference paper: [AttentDifferNet](https://andreluizbvs.github.io/AttentDifferNet/). 

Also in 2023, we had a dataset paper, [InsPLAD](https://andreluizbvs.github.io/InsPLAD/), published at the International Journal of Remote Sensing (Impact Factor: 3.4). This paper was a result of my PhD research in collaboration with two brazilian companies: [In Forma Software](https://www.informa.com.br/) and [Sistema de Transmissão Nordeste](https://stnordeste.com.br/).
