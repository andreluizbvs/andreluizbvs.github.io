Hello, my name is André Luiz Buarque Vieira e Silva and I am a PhD Student in Computer Science at Centro de Informática (CIn) in Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE). I also hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science at UFPE, and my Bachelor's is in Computer Engineering at UFPE. I have experience in the topics of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Particle-based Fluid Simulation, CUDA parallelization, with a special interest in Image-based Defect Inspection and Anomaly Detection.

My PhD research explores Unsupervised Learning to improve Anomaly Detection and Defect Inspection in the wild. Thus, my focus is to propose and investigate Unsupervised Deep Learning approaches to improve automatic defect and anomaly detection on data from "in-the-wild" scenarios, in which defect-related data is quite rare (for example, UAV/drone images of power line assets). Through unprecedented datasets, which I participated in the making, I am exploring the entire inspection process, from the data collection step until deploying the whole system. Besides, my research is concerned with detecting defects and anomalies in challenging scenarios with little prior information regarding the anomaly/defect itself.

From my research findings, I was able to publish scientific papers in high-impact journals such as the Computer Physics Communications and also in leading conferences in Latin America on Computer Vision and VR/AR, such as the Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI) and the Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality (SVR).
