Hello, my name is André Luiz Buarque Vieira e Silva and I am a PhD Student in Computer Science at Centro de Informática (CIn) in Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE). I also hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science at UFPE, and my Bachelor's is in Computer Engineering at UFPE. I have experience in the topics of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Particle-based Fluid Simulation and CUDA parallelization. My current research interest is in Image-based Defect Inspection and Anomaly Detection. Facial biometrics is also a current interest.

My PhD research explores Unsupervised Learning to improve Anomaly Detection and Defect Inspection in the wild. Thus, my focus is to propose and investigate Unsupervised Deep Learning approaches to improve automatic defect and anomaly detection on data from "in-the-wild" scenarios, in which defect-related data is quite rare (for example, UAV/drone images of power line assets). Through unprecedented datasets, which me and my colleagues proposed, I am exploring the entire inspection process, from the data collection step until deploying the whole system. Besides, my research is focused on detecting defects and anomalies in challenging scenarios with little prior information regarding the anomaly/defect itself.

From my research findings, me and my colleagues were able to publish scientific papers in high-impact journals such as the Computer Physics Communications (Impact Factor: 4.72) and also in leading conferences in Latin America on Computer Vision and VR/AR, such as the Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI) and the Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality (SVR). In 2023, we had an <a href=https://vision-based-industrial-inspection.github.io/cvpr-2023/zip/Attention%20Modules%20Improve%20Image%20Level%20Anomaly%20Detection%20A%20Differ%20Net%20Case%20Study%20-%20Andre%20Vieirae%20Silva.zip>accepted poster</a> in a CVPR workshop: <a href=https://vision-based-industrial-inspection.github.io/cvpr-2023>1st workshop on Vision-based InduStrial InspectiON</a> .

During 2022 I was in Germany at TU Chemnitz as a DAAD scholarship holder for six months to deepen my PhD studies. I worked under the guidance of Jun.-Prof. Danny Kowerko in the Media Computing research group to advance the state of the art in Attention-based Image-level Anomaly Detection.
