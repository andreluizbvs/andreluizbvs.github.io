Hello, my name is André Luiz Buarque Vieira e Silva and I am a PhD Student in Computer Science at Centro de Informática (CIn) in Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE). I also hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science at UFPE, and my Bachelor's is in Computer Engineering at UFPE. I have experience on the topics of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Particle-based Fluid Simulation, CUDA parallelization, with a special interest in Image-based Defect Inspection and Anomaly Detection.

My PhD research explores Unsupervised Learning to improve Anomaly Detection and Defect Inspection in the wild. Thus, my focus is to propose and investigate Unsupervised Deep Learning approaches to improve the predictive defect and anomaly detection performance on data from "in-the-wild" scenarions which rare defect-related data, such as UAV images of power lines. Through unprecedented datasets, which I participated in the making, I am exploring the entire inspection process, since the data collection until integrating and deploying the whole system. Besides, my research is concerned with detecting defects and anomalies in challenging scenarios with few prior information regarding the anomaly and defect themselves.

From my research findings, I was able to publish scientific papers in high-impact journals as the Computer Physics Communications and also in leading conferences in Latin America on Computer Vision and VR/AR, as the Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI) and the Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality (SVR).
